0.7 mark - Render the file so that the rendered file does not show any R code (but shows the graph) and upload the file to the discussion thread (An .Qmd and pdf file).

N.B. You can create the document as a HTML document, but you must convert it to pdf. This is due to a Brightspace issue with HTML file uploads, where images, tables, other details etc. are corrupted and missing. (If you used revealjs see Slide 19 of 2_literate_programming_STAT40830).
